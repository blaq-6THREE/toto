# toto - Today, Tomorrow

I created a Todo List app based off of personal experience that when I take my tasks a day at a time I do not get overwhelmed and obligations get accomplished.

The app has 2 displays, that display tasks for TODAY and TOMORROW. Tasks are kept in the TODAY list until 11:59pm. At 11:59, they are deleted and whatever was in the TOMORROW view or tab gets moved into the TODAY tab.

If tasks are not completed they get carried into tomorrow's list which becomes a task in your renewed TODAY list.
